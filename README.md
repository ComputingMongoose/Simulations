# Simulations
This repository contains simulation configurations for the JavaSystemSimulator project (available in its own repository: https://github.com/ComputingMongoose/JavaSystemSimulator )

# How to use

First download the latest JavaSystemSimulator.jar from the Releases: https://github.com/ComputingMongoose/JavaSystemSimulator/tags

To start a simulation run:
```
java -jar JavaSystemSimulator.jar <simulation_folder>
```

Example (assuming the current directory is the repository and the JavaSystemSimulator.jar was downloaded here):
```
java -jar JavaSystemSimulator.jar simulations/Intellec_4_mod_40/basic_system_with_monitor
```

When running a simulation, multiple windows may appear, corresponding to each peripheral device. 
Some devices may allow for mouse interaction, while others will only allow keyboard interaction. 
Each simulation typically has a README file detailing the specifics of that simulation.

A guide for creating new simulations is available here: https://computingmongoose.github.io/jss/howto_simulation.html .
